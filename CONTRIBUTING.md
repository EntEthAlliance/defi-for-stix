# Contributing to the DeFi STIX extensions

Comments should be made by adding a comment to an [open issue](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/EthTrust-public/issues) if there is a relevant issue already, or by creating a 
[new issue](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/EthTrust-public/issues/new/choose). 

If proposals are editorial in nature (i.e. they clarify wording, fix spelling mistakes or obvious logic errors),
the process is fairly straightforward. 

If a proposal suggests a substantive change - e.g. adding a new requirement, or changing a requirement so it will be tested differently, 
through the issue template we request the commenter to complete the 
[EEA Non-member participation agreement](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/EthTrust-public/blob/main/EEA-Non-Member-Participation-Agreement.pdf). 
Essentially this is an agreement not to introduce material covered by a "submarine patent".
